**NAME:**  
APT-Q-27


**Alias**  
GoldenEyeDog, Miuuti Group, 金眼狗


**Description**:   
Recently, in the course of tracking black-market groups, Qi An Xin Virus Response Center discovered a hacker group that targets individuals involved in gambling, dog promotion and overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Its business scope includes remote control, mining, DDoS, and traffic-related activities. The samples are mainly spread in Telegram groups, with good anti-virus effects and highly targeted and tempting bait.
Currently, a large number of overseas users have been detected to be affected, along with a small number of domestic victims. Due to its significant harm, Qi An Xin Virus Response Center has analyzed and traced the origin of this hacker group and revealed their activities based on relevant clues.
As the group targets the gambling industry and has similar goals to the ZeroZeroDog organization we previously tracked, and its bait names are vulgar, it is unsightly, so we named the hacker group GoldenEyeDog, or "金眼狗" in Chinese.
