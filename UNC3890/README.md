**NAME:**  
UNC3890

**Alias**  
UNC3890


**Description**:   
The APT group's earliest attacks date back to 2020. Suspected to have come from Iran, it targeted Israeli shipping, government, energy and health targets. Its attacks post the SUGARUSH/SUGARUSH back door.
UNC3890 uses at least two unique tools: a backdoor which we named SUGARUSH, and a browser credential stealer, which exfiltrates stolen data via Gmail, Yahoo and Yandex email services that weâ€™ve named SUGARDUMP. UNC3890 also uses multiple publicly available tools, such as the METASPLOIT framework and NorthStar C2.
