**NAME:**  
Kremlin  

**Alias**:  
Domino


**Description**:   
Kremlin, named by Clearsky Security Company, is a threat organization mainly targeting the Russian government and national defense. Its earliest attack activities can be traced back to 2019. In the meantime, the Hunting Shadow Lab named it Domino. The delivered harpoon sample was injected through the template to download the subsequent payload. At the same time, the organization also used the unknown 1 day to continue the vulnerability attack, which reflected the organization's very high technical or economic strength.
