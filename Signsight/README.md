**NAME:**  
Signsight  


**Description**:   
Signsight is a supply chain attack mentioned in a report released by ESET in December 2020.During the operation, attackers hacked into VGCA and modified GCA01 software on the site to embed a backdoor to carry out supply chain attacks.The attack was similar to that of Able Desktop's supply chain in Mongolia.L Smanager backdoor (also known as PhantomNet) appeared during this operation. The backdoor is considered by NTT to be a variant of Tmanager, and appears mainly in attacks against Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam.Due to overlapping tools and other reasons, VINCSS (a security company owned by Vietnam's largest conglomerate Vingroup) attributed the operation to TA428.
