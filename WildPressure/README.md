**Description**:   
In August 2019, Kaspersky discovered a malicious campaign distributing a fully fledged C++ Trojan and all the victims were organizations from the Middle East. The compilation timestamp for all these files is the same â€“ March 2019, and the only encryption implemented is the RC4 algorithm with different 64-byte keys for different victims.
