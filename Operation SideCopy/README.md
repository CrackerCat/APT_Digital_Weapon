Operation SideCopy


**Description**:   
SideCopy APT was revealed in 2020 by Quick Heal. The organization was first active in early 2019, targeting Indian Defense Force and armed Forces personnel and army personnel to steal sensitive information. This group often copies the TTP of Sidewinder APT organization for attacks. Almost all C2 belong to Contabo GmbH and the server name is similar to the server name in disclosed Transparent Tribe APT organization report. So the Quick Heal team believes that the group may be connected to Transparent Tribe.
