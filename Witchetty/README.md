ESET first documented Witchetty in April 2022 and concluded that it was one of three subgroups of TA410, a widespread cyberespionage campaign with some ties to the Cicada organization, also known as APT10. The Witchetty campaign features the use of two pieces of malware, a first-stage backdoor called X4 and a second-stage payload called LookBack. ESET reports that the group targets governments, diplomatic missions, charities and industrial/manufacturing organizations.
