**Description**:   
Named by foreign security manufacturer Sygnia, the ELEPHANT BEETLE has been active since 2020. The group steals money from businesses in Latin America's financial sector. Economically motivated threat organizations that target and infiltrate organizations from the financial and business sectors in Latin America.
The group uses an Arsenal of more than 80 unique tools and scripts.
The ring operated undetected for a long time, patiently studying target financial systems, making hidden fraudulent transactions in the middle of regular activities and ultimately stealing millions of dollars.
Elephant Beetle is well versed in Java-based attacks and, in many cases, uses legacy Java applications running on Linux-based machines as an initial means of entry into the environment.
While primarily focused on the Latin American market, Elephant Beetle can expand its reach to global organizations, and our IR team has identified vulnerabilities in a US company's Latin American operations.
