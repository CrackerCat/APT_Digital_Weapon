**NAME:**
Appin

**Description**:
Appin is considered India's oldest hacker-for-hire firm, offering offensive security training programs as well as covert hacking operations since at least 2009. Its employees have spread to new competitors and partners, and the brand continues to grow and has spread to the Cybersecurity industry and defense industry manufacturers. Appin has been so prolific that a staggering number of current Indian APT campaigns are still linked to the original Appin group of companies in some form.
