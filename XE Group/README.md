**NAME:**  
XE Group
  
**Alias**  
XE Group  

**Description**:   
In 2020 and 2021, Volexity identified multiple compromises related to a relatively unknown criminal threat actor that refers to itself as "XE Group". Volexity believes that XE Group is likely a Vietnamese-origin criminal threat actor whose intrusions follow an approximate pattern:
Compromise of externally facing services via known exploits (e.g., Telerik UI vulnerabilities)
Monetization of these compromises through installation of password theft or credit card skimming code for web services related to these servers
