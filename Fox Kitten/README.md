**NAME:**  
Fox Kitten
 

**Description**:   
Fox Kitten, a widespread Iranian offensive campaign named by ClearSky during the last quarter of 2019, has been conducted in the last three years against dozens of companies and organizations in Israel and around the world. ClearSky found an overlap, with medium to high probability, between this campaign’s infrastructure and the activity of an Iranian offensive group APT34, as well as a possible connection between this campaign and the APT33-Elfin and APT39-Chafer groups. The campaign was conducted by using a variety of offensive tools, most of which open-source code-based and some – self-developed. The most successful and significant attack vector was the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in systems with unpatched VPN and RDP services, in order to infiltrate and take control over critical corporate information storages.
