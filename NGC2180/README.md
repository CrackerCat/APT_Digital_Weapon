**NAME:**
NGC2180

**Description**:
At the end of 2023, experts from the Solar 4RAYS research center under the Solar Group discovered traces of international hacker activities in the system of a Russian administrative agency. The attackers used unique, carefully concealed software to conduct espionage operations through hijacked servers of various organizations around the world. The hacker group has been active for at least three years, but experts have not yet been able to accurately determine its origins, so it has been provisionally named NGC2180.
