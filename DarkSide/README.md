**Description**:   
The DarkSide Gang is a Russian-speaking cybercrime group. An analysis of DarkSide's history of intruders revealed that the group uses MetaSploit and other offensive security tool frameworks to scan for vulnerabilities in the targeted networks, with the goal of establishing initial access. After monitoring, the organization logs in to the file server using an account that has the permission of the file server instead of the administrator (domain controller) account through the RDP session.
