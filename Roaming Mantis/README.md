**Description**:   
Roaming Mantis is a malicious campaign that targets Android devices and spreads mobile malware via smishing. It’s been a while since the last blog post, but we’ve observed some new activities by Roaming Mantis in 2021, and some changes in the Android Trojan Wroba.g (or Wroba.o, a.k.a Moqhao, XLoader) that’s mainly used in this campaign. Furthermore, we discovered that France and Germany were added as primary targets of Roaming Mantis, in addition to Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
